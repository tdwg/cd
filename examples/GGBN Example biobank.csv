organisationalUnitDescription,ObjectGroup,"The Ocean Genome Legacy Center (OGL) is a non-profit marine DNA and tissue repository dedicated to exploring and preserving the wealth of information contained in the genomes of endangered, rare, unusual and ecologically critical marine organisms. OGLâ€™s mission is to collect, describe, and preserve genomes from marine species, and to make these materials widely available for scientific research. By providing secure storage and broad public access to genomic materials and a forum for sharing samples, data, and ideas, OGL aims to serve as a catalyst for research that can help to protect marine ecosystems and improve the human condition. Detailed data are available for each specimen listed in our public online catalog."
