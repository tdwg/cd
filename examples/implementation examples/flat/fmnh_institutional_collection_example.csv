description,ObjectGroup,"The Field Museum of Natural History (FMNH), also known as The Field Museum, is a natural history museum in Chicago, Illinois, and is one of the largest such museums in the world.[4] The museum is a popular natural-history museum for the size and quality of its educational and scientific programs,[5][6] as well as due to its extensive scientific-specimen and artifact collections.[7] The permanent exhibitions,[8] which attract up to two million visitors annually, include fossils, current cultures from around the world, and interactive programming demonstrating today's urgent conservation needs.[9][10] The museum is named in honor of its first major benefactor, the department-store magnate Marshall Field. The museum and its collections originated from the 1893 Worldâ€™s Columbian Exposition and the artifacts displayed at the fair.[11]"
