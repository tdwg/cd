# Recipes & Examples for Latimer Core records [DRAFT]

Latimer Core can be used to describe collections at a variety of levels -- for instance, at a more finely detailed expeditions or accession-levels, or at more general departmental or institution-levels.Â  Or both nested within a single record, if that isn't too horrifying.
Each of the sections below is meant to illustrate an example of a different Basis of Scheme (`ltc:basisOfScheme`) value.

## Common to all Latimer Core record-typesThe classes and terms are useful for documenting any Latimer Core record-type
- RecordLevel Class

These classes and terms are useful for documenting an institution:
- Address Class:
- CollectionHistory Class
- ContactDetail Class

CSV/Table 2: Org-Address


## A record for a department within an institution
