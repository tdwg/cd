http://rs.tdwg.org/ltc/terms/attributes/ChronometricAge,Chronometric Age,The age of a specimen or related materials that is generated from a dating assay. This is a categorical term (class) to organize the other chronometric age properties and does not ever have values.,Chronometric_Age
http://rs.tdwg.org/ltc/terms/attributes/CollectionDescriptionScheme,Collection Description Scheme,"A grouping of multiple ObjectGroups for a particular use case, purpose or implementation. Where the same objects within the same collection might be described by more than one ObjectGroup for different purposes (for examples, a 'Darwin Fossil Mammals' collection description might overlap with a 'Offsite Palaeontology' collection description), this class can be used to distinguish between them and avoid double-counting of metrics in queries against the data.",Collection_Description_Scheme
http://rs.tdwg.org/ltc/terms/attributes/CollectionStatusHistory,Collection Status History,"A record of current and past statuses of the object group and the reason for status changes. Use this class to record the history of and reason for changes in the status of the described collection. Types of status described by this class may, for example, include ownership, management, accessibility or accrual policy over time. Dates reflecting the start and end of the status described by this class should be recorded using an instance of TemporalCoverage. If temporalCoverageEndDate is empty, the status can be inferred to be the current status of the collection.",Collection_Status_History
http://rs.tdwg.org/ltc/terms/attributes/ContactDetail,Contact Detail,"Details of a method by which an entity such as a Person or OrganisationalUnit may be contacted. The Address class should be used to store physical or postal addresses. For all other types of contact details, this class should be used.",Contact_Detail
http://rs.tdwg.org/ltc/terms/attributes/Event,Event,An action that occurs at some location during some time. From dwc Class event (http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/version/Event-2018-09-06). Examples include: A specimen collection process. A camera trap image capture. A marine trawl.,Event
http://rs.tdwg.org/ltc/terms/attributes/GeographicOrigin,Geographic Origin,The geographic location from which objects associated with the ObjectGroup were collected.,Geographic_Origin
http://rs.tdwg.org/ltc/terms/attributes/GeologicalContext,Geological Context,"Geological information, such as stratigraphy, that qualifies a region or place.",Geological_Context
http://rs.tdwg.org/ltc/terms/attributes/Identifier,Identifier,"A numeric, textual value, or reference such as an IRI, that can be used to uniquely identify the object to which it is attached. Use this class to document stable identifiers that describe the collections and associated entities being represented in the collection description. For example, person identifiers, taxon identifiers, institution identifiers, organisational unit identifiers, gazetteer identifiers. Identifiers represented by this class may be globally unique, or unique within a given context.",Identifier
http://rs.tdwg.org/ltc/terms/attributes/MeasurementOrFact,Measurement or Fact,"A measurement of or fact about the ObjectGroup representing the objects in the collection description, or the relationship between the ObjectGroup and an associated class. This class can be used to apply measurements, facts or narratives to the ObjectGroup as a whole, or used to qualify the relationship between the ObjectGroup and an associated attribute. For example, an ObjectGroup may contain 100 objects, of which 40 are from Europe and 60 from Africa. In this example, one MeasurementOrFact (count of 100) would be attached to the ObjectGroup, and one to each of the two relationships between the ObjectGroup and GeographicOrigin (Europe: count of 40, Africa: count of 60).",Measurement_or_Fact
http://rs.tdwg.org/ltc/terms/attributes/ObjectClassification,Object Classification,"An informal classification of the type of objects within the ObjectGroup, using a hierarchical structure. This class is used to categorise the ObjectGroup according to an informal, self-referential hierarchy. For example, this can be used to create a hierarchy encompassing biological, geological and anthropological collections, where a single formal taxonomy isn't appropriate.",Object_Classification
http://rs.tdwg.org/ltc/terms/attributes/ObjectGroup,Object Group,An intentionally grouped set of objects with one or more common characteristics.,Object_Group
http://rs.tdwg.org/ltc/terms/attributes/OrganisationalUnit,Organisational Unit,"A unit within an organisational hierarchy which may be at, above or below the institutional level. This class can represent any level of organisational unit, incorporating institutions (e.g. a museum), higher units (e.g. a university to which a museum belongs) and more detailed structures (e.g the departments and divisions within a museum). It can be used to arrange these different units at different levels into a hierarchical structure. Derived from [org:OrganizationalUnit](http://www.w3.org/ns/org#OrganizationalUnit) but is not exactly the same. This class combines aspects of both, class [org:Organization](https://www.w3.org/TR/2014/REC-vocab-org-20140116/#org:Organization) and class [org:OrganizationalUnit](https://www.w3.org/TR/2014/REC-vocab-org-20140116/#org:OrganizationalUnit) from the [W3C Organization Ontology ORG](https://www.w3.org/TR/2014/REC-vocab-org-20140116/#overview-of-ontology). Recommended best practice is to associate a unique, persistent organizational identifier (PID) with each created organizational unit. This will allow an unambiguous and continual identification of the unit, as well as the creation of organizational hierarchies. Existing providers of PIDs for organizations are, e.g. https://grid.ac/ and https://ror.org/. The provision of organizational PIDs might be extended to intra-organizational units in the future. Properties of Class: Identifier can be used to add identifier information for organizational units.",Organisational_Unit
http://rs.tdwg.org/ltc/terms/attributes/Person,Person,"A person (alive or dead). This concept should map to the Schema.org Person class (https://schema.org/Person), and the prov:Person class (http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#Person) in the PROV ontology. In the latter, it is a subclass of prov:Agent, which through which it can map to the RDA recommendations on attribution (http://dx.doi.org/10.15497/RDA00029). The definition is appropriated from the Schema.org class.",Person
http://rs.tdwg.org/ltc/terms/attributes/PersonRole,Person Role,"A qualified association between a Person or OrganisationalUnit and an entity such as an ObjectGroup or MeasurementOrFact that enables the relationship to be contextualised with a specific role and time period. This class is aligned with the prov:qualifiedAttribution property (http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#qualifiedAttribution). It should be used instead of the Activity and PersonActivity classes to link a Person or OrganisationalUnit to an entity in situations where an activity is not know or is irrelevant, for example for describing a person's role within an organisation.",Person_Role
http://rs.tdwg.org/ltc/terms/attributes/RecordLevel,Record Level,The machine-actionable information profile for the collection description digital object.

http://rs.tdwg.org/ltc/terms/attributes/Reference,Reference,"A reference to external resources and information related to the collection description. In the Collection Description standard, this class can be used to store references to publications, policies, datasets and other online resources such as websites, related to classes within the standard.",Reference
http://rs.tdwg.org/ltc/terms/attributes/ResourceRelationship,Resource Relationship,"A relationship between an instance of a class in the collection description standard to another instance of the same class, or an instance of a different class in the standard. In the context of this standard, the resources are the collections of objects represented by the ObjectGroup. This class can be used to define different semantic and hierarchical relationships between ObjectGroups.",Resource_Relationship
http://rs.tdwg.org/ltc/terms/attributes/SchemeMeasurementOrFact,Scheme Measurement Or Fact,"A type of measurement or fact used by the CollectionDescriptionScheme, and the rules relating to its application. This class can be used to specify the qualitative and quantitative metrics that will be included in the CollectionDescriptionScheme using the MeasurementOrFact class, and dictate whether each will be mandatory and/or repeatable. This information can be used by software and queries to constrain and validate the Latimer Core dataset, and determine how and whether metrics can be aggregated and reported. The schemeMeasurementType property should correspond to the measurementType property of the MeasurementOrFact class in order to make the relevant association between the scheme definition and the stored data.",Scheme_Measurement_Or_Fact
http://rs.tdwg.org/ltc/terms/attributes/SchemeTerm,Scheme Term,"A Latimer Core term used by the CollectionDescriptionScheme and the rules relating to its application. This class can be used to define which of the terms (classes and/or properties) within the standard (e.g. GeographicOrigin, Taxon, preservationMethod) are expected to be used within the scheme, and specify whether they're mandatory and/or repeatable. This information can be used by software and queries to validate the data and understand the rules by which metrics can be reported against the specified term.",Scheme_Term
http://rs.tdwg.org/ltc/terms/attributes/StorageLocation,Storage Location,"A physical location (such as a building, room, cabinet or drawer) within the holding institution where objects associated with the collection description are stored or exhibited.",Storage_Location
http://rs.tdwg.org/ltc/terms/attributes/Taxon,Taxon,A group of organisms (sensu http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/OBI_0100026) considered by taxonomists to form a homogeneous unit.,Taxon
http://rs.tdwg.org/ltc/terms/attributes/TemporalCoverage,Temporal Coverage,"A record of a time range represented by the collection's establishment or change over time. This term is separate from the living or geologic periods represented by the objects in the collection. This class can be used to reflect temporal coverage of the collection within various contexts (defined by the temporalCoverageType property). Examples might include the time range in which objects within the collection were collected or the time period over which the collection was assembled.  It should not be used to document the time range within which the objects in the collection were alive, and if the time period you are trying to describe is better described by the CollectionHistory, GeologicalContext or ChronometricAge classes, or period property of the ObjectGroup class, then those classes or properties should be used instead. For example, the period property of the ObjectGroup class and/or GeologicalContext class should be used to record named time periods.",Temporal_Coverage
