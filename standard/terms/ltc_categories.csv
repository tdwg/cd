http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/attributes/ObjectGroupDescriptionScheme,Object Group Description Scheme,"A grouping of multiple ObjectGroups for a particular use case, purpose or implementation. Where the same objects within the same collection might be described by more than one ObjectGroup for different purposes (for example, a 'Darwin Fossil Mammals' collection description might overlap with a 'Offsite Palaeontology' collection description), this class can be used to distinguish between them and avoid double-counting of metrics in queries against the data.",Yes,Yes,Object_Group_Description_Scheme,Record Level,"hasReference, hasIdentifier, hasSchemeMeasurementOrFact, hasSchemeTerm"
http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/attributes/CollectionStatusHistory,Collection Status History,"A record of current and past statuses of the object group and the reason for status changes. Use this class to record the history of and reason for changes in the status of the described collection. Types of status described by this class may, for example, include ownership, management, accessibility or accrual policy over time. Dates reflecting the start and end of the status described by this class should be recorded using an instance of TemporalCoverage.

This class has been defined under the ltc namespace because it only has a subset of the properties of DwC:Event. All ltc:Event properties are borrowed from and reference the dwc namespace. Examples of an Event include: A specimen collection process. A camera trap image capture.

http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/attributes/MeasurementOrFact,Measurement or Fact,"A measurement of or fact about the ObjectGroup representing the objects in the collection description, or the relationship between the ObjectGroup and an associated class. This class can be used to apply measurements, facts or narratives to the ObjectGroup as a whole, or used to qualify the relationship between the ObjectGroup and an associated attribute. For example, an ObjectGroup may contain 100 objects, of which 40 are from Europe and 60 from Africa. In this example, one MeasurementOrFact (count of 100) would be attached to the ObjectGroup, and one to each of the two relationships between the ObjectGroup and GeographicOrigin (Europe: count of 40, Africa: count of 60).",No,Yes,Measurement_or_Fact,"Chronometric Age, Event, Geographic Origin, Geological Context, Object Classification, Object Group, Organisational Unit, Person, Storage Location, Taxon, Temporal Coverage","hasReference, hasIdentifier"
http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/attributes/ObjectClassification,Object Classification,"An informal classification of the type of objects within the ObjectGroup, using a hierarchical structure. This class is used to categorise the ObjectGroup according to an informal, self-referential hierarchy. For example, this can be used to create a hierarchy encompassing biological, geological and anthropological collections, where a single formal taxonomy isn't appropriate.",No,Yes,Object_Classification,"Object Classification, Object Group","hasReference, hasIdentifier, hasMeasurementOrFact, hasObjectClassification"

http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/attributes/OrganisationalUnit,Organisational Unit,"A unit within an organisational hierarchy which may be at, above or below the institutional level. This class can represent any level of organisational unit, incorporating institutions (e.g. a museum), higher units (e.g. a university to which a museum belongs) and more detailed structures (e.g the departments and divisions within a museum). It can be used to arrange these different units at different levels into a hierarchical structure. This class combines aspects of both class org:Organization (https://www.w3.org/TR/2014/REC-vocab-org-20140116/#org:Organization) and class org:OrganizationalUnit (https://www.w3.org/TR/2014/REC-vocab-org-20140116/#org:OrganizationalUnit) from the W3C Organization Ontology ORG (https://www.w3.org/TR/2014/REC-vocab-org-20140116/#overview-of-ontology). Recommended best practice is to associate a unique, persistent organisational identifier (PID) with each created organisational unit. This will allow an unambiguous and continual identification of the unit, as well as the creation of organisational hierarchies. Existing providers of PIDs for organisations are, e.g. https://grid.ac/ and https://ror.org/. The provision of organisational PIDs might be extended to intra-organisational units in the future. Properties of Class: Identifier can be used to add identifier information for organisational units.",No,Yes,Organisational_Unit,"Object Group, Organisational Unit","hasOrganisationalUnit, hasPersonRole, hasAddress, hasContactDetail, hasMeasurementOrFact, hasReference, hasIdentifier"
http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/attributes/Person,Person,"A person (alive or dead). This concept should map to the Schema.org Person class (https://schema.org/Person), and the prov:Person class (http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#Person) in the PROV ontology. In the latter, it is a subclass of prov:Agent, which through which it can map to the RDA recommendations on attribution (http://dx.doi.org/10.15497/RDA00029).

http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/attributes/PersonRole,Person Role,"A qualified association between a Person or OrganisationalUnit and an entity such as an ObjectGroup or MeasurementOrFact that enables the relationship to be contextualised with a specific role and time period. This class is aligned with the prov:qualifiedAttribution property (http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#qualifiedAttribution). It should be used instead of the Activity and PersonActivity classes to link a Person or OrganisationalUnit to an entity in situations where an activity is not know or is irrelevant, for example for describing a person's role within an organisation.",No,Yes,Person_Role,"Event, Measurement Or Fact, Object Group, Organisational Unit, Record Level","hasPerson, hasReference, hasIdentifier, hasTemporalCoverage, hasContactDetail, hasAddress"

http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/attributes/SchemeMeasurementOrFact,Scheme Measurement Or Fact,"A type of measurement or fact used by the ObjectGroupDescriptionScheme, and the rules relating to its application. This class can be used to specify the qualitative and quantitative metrics that will be included in the ObjectGroupDescriptionScheme using the MeasurementOrFact class, and dictate whether each will be mandatory and/or repeatable. This information can be used by software and queries to constrain and validate the Latimer Core dataset, and determine how and whether metrics can be aggregated and reported. The schemeMeasurementType property should correspond to the measurementType property of the MeasurementOrFact class in order to make the relevant association between the scheme definition and the stored data.",No,Yes,Scheme_Measurement_Or_Fact,Collection Description Scheme,"hasReference, hasIdentifier"
http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/attributes/SchemeTerm,Scheme Term,"A Latimer Core term used by the ObjectGroupDescriptionScheme and the rules relating to its application. This class can be used to define which of the terms (classes and/or properties) within the standard (e.g. GeographicOrigin, Taxon, preservationMethod) are expected to be used within the scheme, and specify whether they're mandatory and/or repeatable.

http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/attributes/TemporalCoverage,Temporal Coverage,"A record of a time range represented by the collection's establishment or change over time. This term is separate from the living or geologic periods represented by the objects in the collection. This class can be used to reflect temporal coverage of the collection within various contexts (defined by the temporalCoverageType property). Examples might include the time range in which objects within the collection were collected or the time period over which the collection was assembled.  It should not be used to document the time range within which the objects in the collection were alive, and if the time period you are trying to describe is better described by the `CollectionHistory`, `GeologicalContext` or `ChronometricAge` classes, or period property of the `ObjectGroup` class, then those classes or properties should be used instead. For example, the period property of the `ObjectGroup` class and/or `GeologicalContext` class should be used to record named time periods. `TemporalCoverage` is a repeatable class, but when present as a property of `Event` or `CollectionStatusHistory`, multiple occurences should be avoided and repeated occurences of the parent class should be used instead.",No,Yes,Temporal_Coverage,"Collection Status History, Event, Person Role","hasMeasurementOrFact, hasReference"
