OrganisationalUnit,Organisational Unit,"A unit within an organisational hierarchy which may be at, above or below the institutional level.",,"This class can represent any level of organisational unit, incorporating institutions (e.g. a museum), higher units (e.g. a university to which a museum belongs) and more detailed structures (e.g the departments and divisions within a museum). It can be used to arrange these different units at different levels into a hierarchical structure. This class combines aspects of both class org:Organization (https://www.w3.org/TR/2014/REC-vocab-org-20140116/#org:Organization) and class org:OrganizationalUnit (https://www.w3.org/TR/2014/REC-vocab-org-20140116/#org:OrganizationalUnit) from the W3C Organization Ontology ORG (https://www.w3.org/TR/2014/REC-vocab-org-20140116/#overview-of-ontology). Recommended best practice is to associate a unique, persistent organisational identifier (PID) with each created organisational unit. This will allow an unambiguous and continual identification of the unit, as well as the creation of organisational hierarchies. Existing providers of PIDs for organisations are, e.g. https://grid.ac/ and https://ror.org/. The provision of organisational PIDs might be extended to intra-organisational units in the future.

It should be used instead of the Activity and PersonActivity classes to link a Person or OrganisationalUnit to an entity in situations where an activity is not know or is irrelevant, for example for describing a person's role within an organisation. It is not mandatory to link to either a Person or a Role in this class, to support use cases where a role is known but the person who fulfilled it is not, and where a person is known to have been involved but the context is not.
