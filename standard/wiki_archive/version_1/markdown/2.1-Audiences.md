There are three main audiences for this documentation:

1. **Data-aggregators** - users or groups who have a need to receive standardised collection descriptions.
2. **Data-providers** - users or groups who have collections information that they would like to share.
3. **Data-users** - users or groups who want to understand in more detail the information provided by LtC collection records and collection catalogues implementing the LtC standard. 

Taking into account the variety of use-cases (documented in a [github document](https://github.com/tdwg/cd/tree/master/reference/use_cases) and a [google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SsfwogZ88TgouDJ7EoDqXJFol-eVs7aYdFx504qJNzc/htmlview?pru=AAABfyxGPeI*Y85ToB8bLmUyzDSk3_wuuA#)) for the standard, it is intended that data-aggregators should define a minimal set of classes, properties and relationships between them that best suit their needs. The `CollectionDescriptionScheme` class is important in this context as a method for communicating to data providers the shape and types of information that they need to provide.
