There are several methods by which associations between different `ObjectGroups`, representing collections and subcollections, may be constructed.


## Direct linkage using the ResourceRelationship class

The `ResourceRelationship` class can be used to make direct links between `ObjectGroups`, using the `relationshipOfResource` property to specify the nature of the relationship. For example, a hierarchy of parent-child relationships can be constructed by using `ResourceRelationships` with a `relationshipOfResource` of ‘part of’, or more semantic relationships can be reflected, such as between an `ObjectGroup` of physical collection objects, and an `ObjectGroup` representing digital multimedia artefacts derived from those objects.

With the application of the `relationshipEstablishedDate` property, this method of linkage may also be used to represent changes to physical collections over time (for example, collections that are split up or merged together), or track changes to how the data are organised in Latimer Core (for example, a year after the initial creation of an institution’s collection descriptions dataset, it’s decided to split the `ObjectGroup` representing the whole zoological collection into two `ObjectGroups` representing the vertebrates and invertebrates separately, in order to store more specific descriptions and metrics against them. Creating this kind of provenance relationship enables some continuity of reporting across the two versions of the dataset, even though the shape of the data has changed.

**Figure 1**: An example of using the `ResourceRelationship` class to represent `ObjectGroups` that are part of a larger `ObjectGroup` in a collections hierarchy.

By a similar method, hierarchical structures may also be constructed in other relevant classes to represent breakdowns of collections in different contexts. For example, `OrganisationalUnit` instances may be chained together with `part of` relationships to represent the divisions and subdivisions within an institution. `Taxon` instances may be linked to form a taxonomic hierarchy, or `ObjectClassification` instances linked to create a less formal hierarchy of object types. Using these linked classes and attaching them to `ObjectGroups` enables collections to be arranged in contextual hierarchies instead of (or in addition to) creating explicit relationships between the `ObjectGroups` themselves. **Figure 2** below shows a simple example of creating parallel hierarchies in `ObjectGroups` and `OrganisationalUnits` in a Latimer Core dataset.

## Simple representation of subcollections
A frequent use case of collection descriptions is to have the ability to store a list of notable, historic and important collections that may be part of a larger institutional collection. This scenario can be modelled in Latimer Core using the approach above, by creating an `ObjectGroup` for the parent collection and an `ObjectGroup` for each of the child collections, and linking the children to the parent through the `ResourceRelationship` class.

While this approach provides the ability to attach rich Latimer Core descriptions (including metrics and narratives) to each of these ‘named’ collections, there is also a degree of effort involved in assembling and maintaining this more complex dataset which may not be commensurate with the time and resources available. A more lightweight approach may also be taken in Latimer Core, where use of the `ResourceRelationship’s` `relationshipResourceName` and `relationshipOfResource` properties can be used to generate a simple list of subcollections and attach them to the parent `ObjectGroup` (see **Figure 3** below).

        "relationshipOfResource": "contains"
    }
]
```

This approach also provides a methodology for starting with a fairly simple Latimer Core dataset, and building up the detail over time as and when opportunity and resourcing permits. For example, a dataset might begin with a single ObjectGroup representing the whole institutional collection, and a set of `ResourceRelationship` records listing the divisional collections within that collection. At later points, those subcollections could then be broken out into their own `ObjectGroups` in order to describe and quantify them in more detail.

## Using common entities and controlled vocabularies
`ObjectGroups` can also be indirectly related by the use of common entities and controlled vocabularies to allow associations to be made between them (although this method is more general data good practice, rather than anything specific to the Latimer Core standard). For example, if a controlled vocabulary is used for the `discipline` property of the `ObjectGroup` class, then queries such as ‘find all the `ObjectGroups` representing ‘Botany’ objects’ and ‘provide the total number of ‘Botany’ objects held by the institution’ are easy to execute without the need to create explicit relationships between the multiple `ObjectGroups` involved.

## Using a CollectionDescriptionScheme
The `CollectionDescriptionScheme` class provides a construct for grouping together `ObjectGroups` as part of the same Latimer Core implementation, for a particular use case, and applying rules about how the data may be constrained, validated and interpreted by software agents. This approach is described in more detail in the Collection Description Schemes section.
