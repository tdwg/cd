As described in the [Summary of LtC classes](https://github.com/tdwg/cd/wiki/2.3-Summary-of-LtC-classes) section, the Latimer Core standard (version 1) is made up of 23 classes, each with two or more properties. The central concept of the standard is the `ObjectGroup` class, which represents 'an intentionally grouped set of objects with one or more common characteristics'. 
Arranged around the `ObjectGroup` are a set of classes, such as `GeographicOrigin`, `Taxon` and `GeologicalContext`, which are commonly used to describe and classify the objects within the `ObjectGroup`. There are a set of classes (`OrganisationalUnit`, `CollectionStatusHistory` and `StorageLocation`) intended to reflect aspects of the custodianship, management and tracking of the collections, and a generic class (`MeasurementOrFact`) for storing metrics, narratives and other qualitative or quantitative measures within the standard. A further set of generic, reusable classes are included that enable common concepts (such as people, identifiers and references) to be attached to multiple classes within the standard. Finally, there’s a set of classes that are used to describe the structure of and metadata about the Latimer Core records and contents themselves.

These (loose and informal) categorisations are illustrated in **Figure 1** below, and the concepts are described in more detail later in this section.

## The ObjectGroup concept
The `ObjectGroup` is the core class and concept of the Latimer Core standard. It represents any set of physical or digital objects that we want to describe together as a group, as opposed to representing and describing each individual separately. This will generally be for one or both of the following reasons:

1. There aren't yet, or may never be, individual digital records for all of the separate objects, but we still want to capture, use and share data about them at a higher level, or
2. There is information that applies to the group as a whole (e.g. a narrative or history, a registration number or a contact person), so we want to store this information at the group level rather than duplicating it across multiple object-level records.

In an ideal world where every object in global Natural Science collections has a fully populated and clean digital record, the first reason would disappear. Collection descriptions could then be assembled dynamically by aggregating data from the underlying object-level records. However, even in that far-off scenario where the majority of the data can be assembled automatically from object level records, there are still likely to be use cases for managing some information at the group level.

### What can an ObjectGroup represent?
The Latimer Core definition of an `ObjectGroup` is 

> *“An intentionally grouped set of objects with one or more common characteristics.”*

This is a purposefully broad definition that allows the standard to encompass a wide range of use cases for describing collections or their parts for different reasons. Although the most common and familiar use of collection descriptions has been to describe the collection of a particular institution, conceptually an `ObjectGroup` can represent any set and number of objects that need to be grouped for any purpose. This can scale from a few objects in a drawer to the sum total of all the collections of global natural science institutions: both of these can be represented by an `ObjectGroup`, as can any scale in between.

Some more practical examples of what may be represented by an `ObjectGroup` include:

- The collection of a single institution
- The herbarium collection of a single institution
- The invertebrates wet collection of a single institution
- A named collection provided by a specific donor, or collected by a significant collector
- The Mesozoic mammal collection of an institution
- The unincorporated objects of a particular department within an institution
- The objects in a single drawer, cabinet or room for inventory purposes
- A registration lot of objects brought into an institution together
- A database of images taken from collection specimens
- A dataset of butterfly observations taken as a monitoring time series
- An ex situ tree plantation rescuing remaining genotypes of European ash
- A virtual collection representing all penguin individuals and populations in zoos and aquaria worldwide
- Collections of sightings of animals as part of environmental impact/mitigation projects (e.g., [Toads on Roads](https://www.froglife.org/what-we-do/toads-on-roads/))

Each of these represent a number of objects that are grouped for a certain purpose, with one or more common characteristics (for example, belonging to the same institution, being from the same stratigraphic time period, or being collected by the same person). Those characteristics are described by the `ObjectGroup’s` properties and the other associated classes in Latimer Core, as summarised in Figure 2.
<br/><br/>

## Institutions and organisational units

Collections are held by caregivers. Some collections start out as privately held assemblages, associated generally with a single person. Over the longer term, most surviving collections become preserved and managed by institutions, including for example public or private institutions, organisations, and corporations. Institutions are the administrative entities that are stewards or owners of collections, provide administrative services, maintain and preserve collections, and often employ or dedicate responsible staff to actively manage collections.

For the purpose of integration into a globally applicable collections registry schema, private collections can be considered to be held by a person of a corresponding role (e.g. “steward”) and be part of a theoretical organisation (e.g. “independent operation”, “private residence”). For a more general discussion of organisations, persons and groups as agents see the FOAF Vocabulary Specification (http://xmlns.com/foaf/spec/).

An important element to stress is the distinction between the organisational unit that holds a collection, and the collection itself. An institution is represented by the class `OrganisationalUnit` and its properties. The collection that the institution holds is represented by an `ObjectGroup`. The two can be linked together (**Figure 3**) to represent the custodianship of the `OrganisationalUnit` for the `ObjectGroup`. This means that the properties describing the institution are restricted to the `OrganisationalUnit` and associated classes, while any data describing the collection and the objects within it are represented either by `ObjectGroup` properties, or instances of other Latimer Core classes linked to the `ObjectGroup`.

**Figure 3**: An example of representing and linking organisational units and collections using Latimer Core.

In Latimer Core, the institution concept is inspired by the more generic framework provided by the W3C Organization Ontology (ORG) standard (https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-org/). Institutions can be represented by the `OrganisationalUnit` class, which is more broadly defined than the corresponding term in the ORG standard. In Latimer Core, its definition combines characteristics of both the `org:Organization` and `org:OrganizationalUnit` classes, providing more flexibility. Plans for the future include further development of the intersection between ORG and LtC, to improve alignment and thus enable seamless extension and integration of both standards by each other.

The Latimer Core class `OrganisationalUnit` provides a simplified approach to representing institutional information and institutional structure, for example, for a local collection management catalogue maintained by a collection-holding institution or a local research group managing their research collections and groups of specimens on loan from a variety of scientific collections. In these cases, it can be sufficient to provide the `ltc:OrganisationalUnits` directly responsible for the collections or groups of objects. It might not be necessary to represent complete, sometimes byzantine institutional hierarchies.

For larger-scale, e.g. national to regional and global, registry projects, as for example GRSciColl (https://www.gbif.org/grscicoll) and GGBN (https://www.ggbn.org/ggbn_portal/), as well as longer-term LtC-based implementations that are expected to grow and develop, we recommend to take advantage of the full functionality and power of the Organization Ontology standard for representing institutions, their legal status, structure, employees, addresses, etc. (**Figure 4**). The seamless linking to and extension of Latimer Core by the Organization Ontology W3C standard, and the other way around, is made possible by the Darwin Core `dwc:ResourceRelationship` class (see below). Thereby, the integration of collection and institution registries, e.g. the GBIF Registry of Scientific Collections (https://www.gbif.org/grscicoll) and the Research Organization Registry (https://ror.org/) is enabled (see e.g. Politze 2021, https://easychair.org/publications/open/r8Dv). In general, this option provides implementers of LtC to choose whether to use the LtC `OrganisationalUnit` and associated generic classes to represent organisations and related structures, or to instead link in ORG for more complex structures. It should also prove relatively straightforward to start with the former, and transition to the latter at a later point in time.
<br/><br/>

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8615321/174122069-b6aed493-9df9-49b5-b017-fc9077c51c2f.png)

**Figure 4**: With reference to the example in **Figure 3**, an example of using ORG with LtC to represent organisations and organisational units, instead of the LtC `OrganisationalUnit` class.

The `ltc:OrganisationalUnit` class can represent, in addition to institutions as (legal) entities, subdivisions at different levels within an institution (e.g. departments, divisions, sections, faculties etc), as well as organisations at a higher level of the collection-holding institution (for example, a museum may be a subunit within the organisational structure of a university). Terms to be used in predefined vocabularies identifying the hierarchical position of an organisational unit within an organisational structure can be found in the “Academic Institution Internal Structure Ontology” (AIISO; https://vocab.org/aiiso/). 

Within Latimer Core, `OrganisationalUnits` can be linked together into a hierarchy or structure using the `dwc:ResourceRelationship` class borrowed from the Darwin Core standard (DWC). Similarly, the links between the institutional level (implemented within the LtC or following the ORG standard) and the collection level (LtC standard) are build using the `dwc:ResourceRelationship` class. The `dwc:relationshipOfResource` property of the class should be used to describe the nature of the relationship. It is recommended best practice (see https://dwc.tdwg.org/list/#dwc_ResourceRelationship) to use a controlled vocabulary to describe those relationships. Relationship types listed as examples by the Darwin Core webpage are “same as”, “part of”, “contains”. Alternatively, AIISO terms can be used, e.g. [part_of](https://vocab.org/aiiso/#part_of), [responsibilityOf](https://vocab.org/aiiso/#responsibilityOf), [responsibleFor](https://vocab.org/aiiso/#responsibleFor).

Within the `ObjectGroup`-centric Latimer Core model, associated `OrganisationalUnits` are essentially treated as properties of the `ObjectGroup`, rather than as a higher level in a rigid hierarchy. The notation for the property `organisationalUnitName` of the class `OrganisationalUnit` is correctly `ltc:ObjectGroup.OrganisationalUnit.organisationalUnitName` or in a short form `ltc:OrganisationalUnit.organisationalUnitName`, since in LtC the `ObjectGroup` class is per default the core element. 

In a general graph context (**Figure 3** and **Figure 4**), both classes, `ObjectGroup` and `OrganisationalUnit`, can be considered to be at the same level and can be directly associated (they are within each other’s range, see the section on [Ranges and class level properties](https://github.com/tdwg/cd/wiki/2.5-Ranges-and-class-level-properties)). This link can be looked at and approached from both directions, the point of view taken thereby varies between concrete use cases and serialisations. The collection-centric LtC perspective is to approach the association from the side of the ObjectGroup, therefore, in LtC `OrganisationalUnit` is a class-level property of `ObjectGroup`, accordingly in **Table 1** of the [Ranges and class level properties](https://github.com/tdwg/cd/wiki/2.5-Ranges-and-class-level-properties) section, only `OrganisationalUnit` can be attached to `ObjectGroup` and not the other way around. However, in a context outside of LtC, e.g. with a focus on describing organisations (cp. the [W3C org ontology](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-org/)), `ObjectGroup` will be a class-level property of `Organization` or `OrganizationalUnit`.
<br/><br/>

## Generic Classes

Some classes can be used in multiple contexts within the LtC standard. These classes, listed in Table 1, are referred to here as ‘generic’ classes. 

Generic classes represent a type of entity or concept that can be a property of, or associated with, several LtC classes. An `OrganisationalUnit`, `Taxon`, and `Person` all might require an `Identifier` of some sort, for instance. Rather than explicitly repeating the same set of fields within each class, one or more instances of the generic `Identifier` class can be used instead. 
<br/><br/>

Generic Class | Range
-- | --
Reference | Identifier, TemporalCoverage, RecordLevel, CollectionStatusHistory, ResourceRelationship, GeographicOrigin, GeologicalContext, ChronometricAge, Taxon, Event, Person, PersonRole, ObjectGroup
Identifier | Reference, RecordLevel, GeographicOrigin, GeologicalContext, ChronometricAge, Taxon, StorageLocation, Event, ObjectClassification, OrganisationalUnit, Person, ObjectGroup, CollectionDescriptionScheme
TemporalCoverage | CollectionStatusHistory, Event, PersonRole, measurementOrFact
MeasurementOrFact | ObjectGroup, OrganisationalUnit, GeographicOrigin, GeologicalContext, ChronometricAge, ObjectClassification, Taxon, TemporalCoverage, Person, StorageLocation, Event
PersonRole | ObjectGroup, RecordLevel, OrganisationalUnit, MeasurementOrFact, Event
Person | CollectionStatusHistory, Event, PersonRole, measurementOrFact, Taxon, TemporalCoverage, StorageLocation, ContactDetail, Address, OrganisationalUnit, SpecimenIdentifierSystem, Reference
Address | Person, OrganisationalUnit, StorageLocation
ContactDetail | Person, OrganisationalUnit, ObjectGroup, PersonRole
ResourceRelationship | ObjectGroup, RecordLevel

The overall purpose of any given instance of a generic class can be inferred from its context in the record: a `ContactDetail` that is associated with or nested within an `OrganisationalUnit` is an organisational contact point, but a `ContactDetail` associated or nested within a `Person` should be interpreted as that `Person’s` preferred method of contact (illustrated in **Figure 8**).
<br/><br/>

<img src ="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8563362/170293206-3cd77c93-e2b9-4c10-8059-6ed836661a43.png" width="700" alt="ContactDetail Class representing email contacts formatted in JSON" />

There are several benefits to taking this approach, using the `Identifier` class as an example: 

1. Flexibility: a generic `Identifier` class can be used to represent any identifier relevant to classes within its range, so the standard needn’t attempt to anticipate all potential current or future use cases.
2. Extensibility: Easier addition of supporting properties to the concept:  e.g. `identifier` is further described by `identifierSource`, `identifierType` etc.
3. Reduced number of properties in the standard.
4. Support for the association of multiple identifiers (as shown in Figures 4, 5 and 6) with the same entity: see the [Repeatable properties and classes](https://github.com/tdwg/cd/wiki/2.6-Repeatable-properties-and-classes) section.

## People and roles
To handle people and roles, Latimer Core uses a simplified version of the RDA/TDWG Attribution metadata recommendations (https://datascience.codata.org/articles/10.5334/dsj-2019-054/), which is substantially based on the PROV ontology (https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/). Using this approach avoids both the hardcoding of all potential roles people might play in relation to the different classes in the standard, and the proliferation of similar properties that would be required to support them.

To this end, there are two classes within the standard that are used to represent people and roles: `Person` and `PersonRole`. The `Person` class is used to describe the relevant person, and the `PersonRole` to attach that person to another class and define the role that they played in the context of that class (and, optionally, the time frame during which they fulfilled that role). `PersonRole` is a generic class (see previous section) which can be attached to a range of other classes within the standard, as demonstrated in **Figures 9 and 10** below.
<br/><br/>

![Fig8](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8615321/172664142-72933b6f-3b51-4c18-9ea5-ba2593a0c84f.png)

**Figure 10:** An example of using the `Person` and `PersonRole` classes to link people to collections, organisations and digital records in the relevant contexts.
<br/><br/>

The Latimer Core implementation differs from the RDA/TDWG recommendations in a couple of key respects:
- Rather than use the PROV `Agent` entity, which has subclasses of `Person`, `Organization` and `SoftwareAgent`, Latimer Core currently only uses the ‘Person’ subtype within this model, and OrganisationalUnit is represented by a separate class.
- The PROV model connects the `Agent` to an `Entity` using an `Activity` class, with the role represented by a qualified association between the `Agent` and the `Activity`. In the current version of Latimer Core, the activity concept has been removed from the model to simplify the association. 
These modifications are largely to reduce the level of abstraction in the initial version of Latimer Core, and make the classes more familiar and model simpler for users of the standard. There may be potential to use the full `Agent` scope and introduce the `Activity` concept in future iterations of Latimer Core to more fully align with PROV and possible developments within other TDWG standards.

## Metrics and narratives

Two components frequently included in collection descriptions are quantitative metrics (e.g. the precise or estimated number of objects or taxa) and richer narratives about the collection and its history. To represent these, Latimer Core has adopted the `MeasurementOrFact` class used in Darwin Core and ABCD, and added a `measurementFactText` property. This property is for holding the richer text narratives in collection descriptions and if required categorising them using the `measurementType` property. This might be used, for example, to define and store a historical narrative and brain-dump of notes from a retiring curator about a collection separately. It also separates the text descriptions from quantitative measures stored in the `measurementValue` property, which is intended to make validation and programmatic aggregation and computation on the `measurementValue` property more straightforward. 
<br/><br/>

```json
"ObjectGroup": {

    "collectionName": "Collection of the Natural History Museum, London",

    "MeasurementOrFact": [
	{
	    "measurementType": "Object count",
	    "measurementValue": "72190070"
	},
	{
	    "measurementType": "Collection history",
	    "measurementMethod": "Text narrative",
	    "measurementRemarks": "Text derived from Wikipedia",
	    "measurementFactText": "The foundation of the collection was that of the Ulster doctor Sir Hans Sloane (1660–1753), who allowed his significant collections to be purchased by the British Government at a price well below their market value at the time. This purchase was funded by a lottery. Sloane's collection, which included dried plants, and animal and human skeletons, was initially housed in Montagu House, Bloomsbury, in 1756, which was the home of the British Museum."
	}
    ]
}

```

**Figure 11:**  JSON example of a quantitative metric and textual narrative using the `MeasurementOrFact` class.

Similarly to the other generic classes described earlier, the `MeasurementOrFact` class can be associated with many of the other classes in the standard to add defined, dynamic properties, and is also repeatable.

It’s also possible to use the `MeasurementOrFact` class to qualify or quantify relationships between other classes in the standard, in conjunction with the `ResourceRelationship` class. This is covered in more detail in the later section on [modelling approaches](https://github.com/tdwg/cd/wiki/2.8-Modelling-approaches).


### Metric examples

There are no prescribed metrics included in the standard. It is hoped that over time data requestors/aggregators will define the metrics that they require using the standard and its `MeasurementOrFact` class. Data providers can then use these as recipes to follow to generate the information needed to facilitate easier and more automated sharing and comparison.
<br/><br/>

Metric Description | measurementType
-- | --
object count | The total number of specimens and/or items. If the metric is attached to an object group then the count is of the collection being described. If the metric is attached to the Institution then it is the overall count for that institution.
digitisation level percentage | The percentage of the whole collection being described that is digitised [define digitised]. Could be used in combination with the object count metric.
digitisation level count | An actual number of digitised records in the collection being described [define digitised]
imaged level percentage | The percentage of the collection described in the record that has an image. Could be used in combination with the object count metric.
imaged level count | An actual number of digitised records with images
georeferenced level percentage | The percentage of the collection described in the record that has verified Lat Lon coordinates. Could be used in combination with the "object count" metric.
georeferenced level count | The actual number of records that have verified Lat Lon coordinates
taxonomic rank | Count of the taxa at the rank indicated in measurementFactText. Do not abbreviate the rank.
storage volume | The cubic volume of the record (Institutional or Collection). Could be used in combination with the object count metric.
storage footprint | The area of the record (Institutional or Collection). Could be used in combination with the object count metric.
