# Latimer Core Guidance Documentation

## Current Wiki Version 1.x

## 1. Introduction to Latimer Core documentation 

This wiki is intended to support the [normative definitions](https://github.com/tdwg/rs.tdwg.org/blob/latimer/process/page_build_scripts/index.md) by providing further information on the terms and concepts represented in the Latimer Core (LtC) standard, and guidance on how the standard may be used in practice. The wiki content is non-normative and may be modified, improved and extended over time. 

**Summary of the standard**

The Latimer Core (LtC) schema is a standard designed to support the representation, discovery and communication of natural science collections, by representing metadata for the **[groups of objects](https://github.com/tdwg/cd/wiki/2.4-Core-elements-of-the-standard#the-objectgroup-concept)** that those collections and their subcomponents encompass. Individual objects within those groups can be represented through other emerging or current standards (e.g., [Darwin Core](https://dwc.tdwg.org/), [ABCD](https://www.tdwg.org/standards/abcd/) and [Dublin Core](https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dcmi-terms/)). The classes and properties (collectively terms) aim to represent information that describes these groupings in enough detail to inform deeper discovery of the resources contained within them. Many LtC terms are borrowed or derived from those standards which are used to describe individual items. As far as possible the terms included in the standard should not preclude their use across domains.
