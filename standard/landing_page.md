title: Latimer Core
summary: The Latimer Core (LC) schema is a standard designed to support the representation, discovery and communication of natural science collections. The classes within the standard aim to allow the high-level representation of any given collection by providing a framework within which the set of defining characteristics shared by objects in the collection can be described. The creation of collection-level records is hoped to promote visibility and use of items in collections that are otherwise wholly or partially undigitised at a granular level.

Abstract
: The Latimer Core (LC) schema is a standard designed to support the representation, discovery and communication of natural science collections. The classes within the standard aim to allow the high-level representation of any given collection by providing a framework within which the set of defining characteristics shared by objects in the collection can be described. The creation of collection-level records is hoped to promote visibility and use of items in collections that are otherwise wholly or partially undigitised at a granular level.

## Parts of the standard

The Latimer Core standard is comprised of 20 classes, 109 properties and four documents:

* [Latimer Core Introduction](https://github.com/tdwg/cd/introduction) (http://rs.tdwg.org/cd/doc/introduction/) - a brief introduction to the standard
* [Latimer Core Structure](https://github.com/tdwg/cd/structure) (http://rs.tdwg.org/cd/doc/structure/) - the normative description of the structure of Latimer Core
* [Latimer Core Term List](https://github.com/tdwg/cd/termlist) (http://rs.tdwg.org/cd/doc/termlist/) - a complete list of classes and properties included in Latimer Core, with their normative definitions
* [Latimer Core Guide](https://github.com/tdwg/cd/guide) (http://rs.tdwg.org/cd/doc/guide/) - a more detailed guide to the aims and uses of the standard

## Maintenance group

Latimer Core is maintained by a specialized Interest Group whose [charter](https://github.com/tdwg/cd/blob/master/charters/task_group_charter/tg_charter.md) was approved in *************. The functions of the Latimer Core Maintenance Group are described in detail in **********. In brief, the Maintenance Group manages class and property additions and changes, and maintains the documentation that helps users to understand and apply the standard. As an Interest Group, it may establish Task Groups to accomplish broader changes to the standard.

The activities of the LC Maintenance Group are documented at the group's Github repository, <https://github.com/tdwg/lc>, where a current list of core members and their contact information can be found.  Community participation is welcome.  If you would like to participate in this group, contact the convener or one of the core members.  

To participate in the communications of the group, "watch" the group's [Issues tracker](https://github.com/tdwg/cd/issues).  This issues tracker is the mechanism for suggesting specific changes to the standard as well as to raise issues for discussion by the group.
