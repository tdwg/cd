# Collection Descriptions FAQs [DRAFT]


## What does a Collection Description record represent?
A Collection Description record can describe the temporal, geographic, taxonomic scope and other aspects of a group of items, in a quantifiable way.  
From this, it can make collections findable and measurable in terms of their scale and scope, even if the items they include are not yet digitized.


## What can a Collection Description record look like?
Depending on the descriptive information available, consider the [examples folder](https://github.com/tdwg/cd/tree/master/examples).


## What defines a museum?
Consider the definition from the [International Council of Museums (ICOM)](https://icom.museum/en/resources/standards-guidelines/museum-definition/):
"A museum is a non-profit, permanent institution in the service of society and its development, open to the public, which acquires, conserves, researches, communicates and exhibits the tangible and intangible heritage of humanity and its environment for the purposes of education, study and enjoyment."
Or others from [IMLS](https://www.imls.gov/grants/apply-grant/eligibility-criteria) and [AAM](https://www.aam-us.org/programs/accreditation-excellence-programs/eligibility-to-participate-in-the-accreditation-program/).


## What is a 'collection'?
We are still figuring this out, but related discussions can be found here:
