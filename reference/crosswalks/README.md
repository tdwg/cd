## Crosswalks and Mappings
Since realizing the need for standards to more effectively share collections-levels metadata, several groups have invested time and effort to develop crosswalks between existing standards, and existing software schemas (like at GRBio). We provide links to these resources here and ask that you add more if you have them.  

Initially, we are using a Google Spreadsheet as the collaboration platform for crosswalks.  We will try to keep a snapshot of those documents deposited here, but the snapshots are not the master documents.

#### Field Museum (FM) Insights
Open this [google doc: Field Museum Take on NCD](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1upx7URInghFCBhx5LnHJMAhOLA2Q6xuJAYIJI2uLXBA/edit?usp=sharing) to look at the FM's evaluation of NCD and current insights about the needs for a standard to share collections-level metadata. Also note their related presentation at TDWG 2017: [What's Missing from All the Portals](https://biss.pensoft.net/article/20236/) on the same topic.
